<h2>Games I like to play</h2>

<p>
	A few years ago I fell in love with playing board games with friends and family. I tend to enjoy the strategy and more complex games the most, including games like Risk, Twilight Imperium, and Scythe. But my favorite game is definatley Dungeons and Dragons, which I know isn't technicaly a board game but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable to play. I've included a picture of what my current character looks like below, this image also acts as a link to a popular website used to create and manage D&D characters.
